**Pac-Man edge detector exercise**

**Description**

This is an exercise for my MIT xPro certification course: Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. The focus of the exercise was writing the checkPageBounds function in the pacman.js file, which calculates when to change direction, thereby selecting a different sub-array of images for the animation.

**Usage**

If you want to run this locally, download all files in "pacman" folder on my GitHub
