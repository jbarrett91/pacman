**Pac-Man edge detector exercise**

**Description**

This is an exercise for my MIT xPro certification course: Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. In this exercise, I needed to encode edge detection for Pac-man, so that he would turn around in the opposite direction when reaching the window's edge. The focus of the exercise was writing the checkPageBounds function in the pacman.js file, which calculates when to change direction, thereby selecting a different sub-array of images for the animation.

**Usage**

If you want to run this locally, download all files in "pacman" folder on my GitHub
